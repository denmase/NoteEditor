# Roadmap

This is a working list of planned features for JianpuEditor, kept as plain notes rather than GitHub issues for now.

## Now: instrument playback (top priority)

**Status: Phase 1 and Phase 2 implemented.**

Until now, playback always used whatever General MIDI patch 0 (Acoustic Grand Piano) the system's default MIDI device happened to fall back to — there was no instrument selection anywhere in the app (playback or MIDI export), and sound quality/timbre depended entirely on whatever GM device Windows happened to provide.

- **Phase 1 (done):** Per-score instrument selection.
  - `JianpuScore` gained `MelodyInstrument` / `ChordInstrument` (General MIDI program numbers, 0-127), saved/loaded with the score, defaulting to 0 for full backward compatibility with existing files.
  - `Edit → Instruments...` (and a toolbar button next to Play/Stop) opens a dialog with two dropdowns listing all 128 GM instrument names.
  - Both **live playback** (`ScorePlaybackService`) and **MIDI export** (`MidiExportService`) now send a Program Change message for the melody and chord channels before notes play, so exported `.mid` files sound the same as in-app playback.
  - Instrument changes go through the existing undo/redo command stack, like other header edits.
  - `WindowsMidiSynthesizer` was extracted behind a new `IMidiOutput` interface so playback logic is unit-testable without a real MIDI device.
- **Phase 2 (done):** Consistent sound quality via a bundled SoundFont, replacing the OS's default synth for playback.
  - Playback now goes through **BASSMIDI** (`JianpuEditor/Services/BassMidiSynthesizer.cs`, via the `ManagedBass`/`ManagedBass.Midi` NuGet wrappers) loading a bundled SoundFont (`JianpuEditor/Resources/Soundfonts/GeneralUser-GS.sf2`, permissively licensed), so playback sounds the same on every machine instead of depending on whatever GM device Windows happens to ship.
  - Falls back to the old `WindowsMidiSynthesizer` (system MIDI mapper) automatically if BASSMIDI/the SoundFont fails to initialize for any reason.
  - **Original plan was MeltySynth (pure C#, MIT) + NAudio**, but every MeltySynth release targets `netstandard2.1`+, which .NET Framework 4.7.2 (this app's TFM) cannot consume at all — not a licensing issue, a hard compatibility wall. Switched to BASSMIDI (native DLL via P/Invoke, framework-agnostic) instead.
  - **Licensing note:** BASS/BASSMIDI is free only for individual, non-commercial use — see `JianpuEditor/Native/NOTICE.md` before distributing a commercial fork. `bass.dll`/`bassmidi.dll` (x86 + x64) are bundled directly since they can't be fetched via NuGet/package restore.
  - MIDI export is untouched (still raw MIDI file writing, unaffected by which engine renders it).
- **Phase 3 (later, bigger lift):** VSTi hosting — let users load a third-party VST/VST3 instrument plugin for real sample-library sound. This needs a real-time audio engine (today's playback is a simple MIDI-event dispatch loop, not audio rendering) plus either a native plugin bridge or an existing host. Two candidates worth a dedicated spike: BASS's own **BASSVST** add-on (same vendor/licensing as BASSMIDI, so no new licensing question), or hosting VST3 directly (its SDK is GPLv3-licensed unless you buy a commercial license from Steinberg — same kind of conflict with this project's Apache-2.0 license as before, needs resolving either way). Treat as a separate, larger spike.

## Plugin system (generalized from upstream #26)

Upstream issue #26 asked for a narrow "sample plugin registers a custom symbol" proof of concept. Generalizing that into an actual extension mechanism:

- Define a small `IJianpuPlugin` contract (e.g. `Initialize(IPluginHost host)`) and a host-side plugin loader (scan a `plugins/` folder next to the .exe for DLLs implementing it).
- Expose a couple of real extension points through `IPluginHost`: register a custom ornament/symbol, add a toolbar button, contribute a menu item.
- Ship one first-party sample plugin in the repo (`JianpuEditor.SamplePlugin`) as both a working example and a smoke test that the API is usable end-to-end.
- Document how to build/deploy a plugin in the README.

## MIDI → Jianpu import (already exists — promote out of "Spike")

`MidiImportService` already does this (see `File → Import MIDI...`), but it's labeled experimental. To make it a first-class feature:
- Harden multi-track MIDI handling (today it picks one melody track; add a track picker for multi-track files).
- Expand test coverage for real-world MIDI files (different DAWs export slightly differently).
- Drop the "(Spike)" label once it's reliable enough, and document supported/unsupported MIDI features in the README.

## Audio/image → Jianpu (AI-assisted, new)

Genuinely new, higher-risk/experimental territory:
- **Audio → Jianpu:** pitch/onset detection (e.g. via an ML pitch tracker) on a hummed or recorded melody, converting detected notes to a draft score.
- **Image → Jianpu:** OCR of a photographed/scanned Jianpu sheet into an editable score.
- Both should be explicitly marked experimental/best-effort in the UI (accuracy will vary a lot with input quality) and live behind a clearly-labeled menu entry, not the main import path.

## Professional UI (new, needs more definition)

"Professional" is vague on its own — breaking it into concrete, independently-shippable pieces:
- Modernize the WinForms visual style beyond the current flat theme + dark mode (custom-drawn menu/toolbar chrome, consistent spacing/icons instead of text-only toolbar buttons).
- High-DPI correctness pass (test at 150%/200% scaling).
- Resizable/dockable panels instead of the current fixed toolbar + canvas layout.
- Live note preview under the cursor while entering notes.
- User-customizable keyboard shortcuts (today's shortcuts are hardcoded).

## Other suggested features

A few additions worth considering, not asked for explicitly but adjacent to the above:
- **Real-time MIDI keyboard input:** play notes on a connected MIDI keyboard to enter/audition them live, instead of only the number-key entry.
- **Metronome / count-in** during playback and recording.
- **Multi-part scores:** today's model is one melody + chord markers; a genuine multi-instrument/multi-staff score (e.g. piano LH/RH, or vocal + accompaniment as independently playable parts) is a bigger data-model change worth scoping separately.
- **Auto-save & crash recovery** — periodic snapshot of the working score so a crash doesn't lose unsaved edits.
- **Direct printing**, not just PDF export.
